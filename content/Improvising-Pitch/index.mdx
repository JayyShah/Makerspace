# Time to rewrite your pitch deck

- Each founder took to the stage and introduced themselves like this: “Hi my name is … I am the founder of … and my company redefines … Or reimagines, or revolutionizes, or rethinks. The overuse and abuse of these words just made all the presentations sound the same.

- At that point, the only thing you’re doing is recycling the message of the founder before you.

- What if you were in the waiting room of a VC office knowing that the founder before you used the same words you are about to use? Will you go into the meeting using the exact same terms?

## Cut the business buzzwords from your story

- One of my biggest tips to founders who are trying to sell their vision and raise money is this: don’t talk to impress, just use everyday language.

- By using lingo that everyone else is using, you position yourself below the attention threshold. You are not going above the noise.

- Your story is one of a kind, you came up with it, no one thought of it before you. Say it your way, with your words.Don’t fall into the big word impression trap.

# Don’t sell to investors, connect with them

- These are a bit different but also a big no-no. Investors can sniff them out a mile away and will immediately label you as an inauthentic founder or template speaker.

- Few companies came up and stated the following:

- “We are disrupting a 100-year-old industry”

- “We are the world’s #1 …”

- Are you really?

- If you’re in the stages of early seed-to-A fundraising, my recommendation is to avoid wow statements. One, they’re generic and, two, they’ll probably raise red flags. Instead, focus on creating a connection.

- My advice is to always remember that your goal in an investor meeting is to connect, not to sell.

- It sounds counterintuitive to many, but it’s a formula that has proven to work time after time after time.

- Speak your vision, your truth, your story, and the rest will follow.
