# The process behind the problem: How to find your company’s purpose

- When it comes to pitch decks, there are so many templates and approaches that give the “right” direction on how to prepare your investor presentation.

- On the whole, I’m not a big fan of templates. I think that every founder and every company has a unique story to tell — and that story should not be dictated by a template.

- But there is one template that offers a different approach and that’s the Sequoia Capital 10-slide deck.

- The one unique thing about it is that Sequoia Capital suggests starting the presentation with the company purpose.

- Company purpose? Is that the same thing as the market problem the company is trying to solve? The answer is no.

- Most founders are struggling to define their purpose. The problem is easy. The solution is easy because they came up with it. But what’s the purpose?

## Get to the root of the problem

- To find your company purpose, ask yourself this: what’s the process that’s driving the problem I’m trying to solve?

- The process drives the purpose.

- Think about it, the market problem you’re trying to solve didn’t come out of thin air. Something is creating that problem.

- The problem and solution is how you monetize the existing process. The purpose is to eliminate the process that is creating the problem.

- Here’s an interesting story to shed light on this.

- When Uber presented their first ever pitch deck, the company stated the following: “We are here to digitize car hailing and make street hailing unnecessary.”

- Let’s break that down:

    - The market problem — people are tired of battling the streets for a cab, the medallion system is driving low quality service, and non-taxi car services need to be booked three hours in advance.

    - The solution — an app-based two-way communication channel that brings the driver and passenger together to secure a ride at a desired time.

- Notice how their purpose is not so different to their market problem?

- So, when preparing your investor deck, I strongly suggest that you define your purpose clearly.

- That will not only drive better presentations, but will also serve as a guide to your company’s mission and vision while driving internal conviction with your teams.

# Process > problem > purpose

- After the purpose is clearly defined, I recommend avoiding following the template of Sequoia Capital. Not to ignore it. But to avoid structuring your presentation in 10 bulky sections as their pitch deck dictates.

- The first three slides in their pitch deck are the purpose, the problem, and the solution.

- My suggestion, combine all three into a purposeful story.

- Deliver a true, real story as to what inspired you to start your company, why you came up with the problem, and how your solution is fixing both the problem and the process.

- Creating a purposeful story will not only drive the right connection with your potential investor, it will loop in all three elements into a single delivery, giving greater context and energy to your pitch.
